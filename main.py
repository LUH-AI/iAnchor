"""
Our design goals:
    - Docstring comments with auto generation of doc
    - Unit test (pytest)
    - clear abstraction between different input task
    - use torch or numpy but not both
    - no magic numbers
    - use dataclasses

Next steps:
    - Implement Image Sampler
    - Implement KL-LUCB Class

# Try our approach and compare to original code in terms of complexity and time
